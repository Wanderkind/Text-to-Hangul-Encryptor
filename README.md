# Text-to-Hangul-Encryptor
for Version 1 (v1):

    The two initial files encryptorv1_initial.py and decryptorv1_initial:

        Are to be integrated into one code; to be fixed at later updates.
        Encryptor does not support texts with line breaks; to be fixed at later updates.

    The encyption methods for this version are based on integer substitution, elementary algebra, and Gronsfeld cipher mechanisms; to be enhanced at later versions.
